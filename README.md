### What my LinkedIn says about me

"Give me a data visualization task, along with a train ticket, and I will work tirelessly".

I am a technically skilled, goal-oriented, independent scientist, and multidisciplinary communicator. Fascinated by the hidden messages concealed within data, I am enhancing my skillset to become a data scientist. 

I obtained a Ph.D. in theoretical physics, during which I worked in international groups and communicated my findings in workshops and publications in high-impact factor journals.

Data science gives me the challenge, communication gives me the energy.
On one hand, I am drawn to the quantitative aspects of data science, seeking the excitement that comes from solving complex problems and uncovering insights through analysis. On the other hand, it is not enough to simply extract messages from data; it is crucial to effectively communicate them. The communicative aspect of data science fuels my passion for the field. 

During the WBS training, I am gaining proficiency in applied data science, engineering, and analysis through eight hands-on projects. I utilized languages like Python and SQL while working with tools such as Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data visualization. The training covered topics like data modeling, A/B testing, machine learning, and cloud computing using AWS.
